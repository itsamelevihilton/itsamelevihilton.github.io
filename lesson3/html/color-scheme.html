            <h3>Many Shades of Brown</h3>
            <p>
                Because of the link that my website has to rocks, I opted to go for rock and dirt colors.  As a quick disclaimer, I am a bit colorblind so if one of these browns turns out to be more green than brown don't worry, it is probably bugging you a heck of a lot more than it is bugging me.  So for the header background I have a slightly dark brown.  To make the title of the website really pop I have given it a super dark brown shadown and made the text a tan color.  For the Nav bar I have the same tan color for the text and have a variety of darker browns as the background depending on whether it is the active page or not.  The background for the body is the tan from the text in the header and nav, but the text in this section is the dark brown from the shadows above.  For each section I have another color that can be described simply as brown.  This brown is closest to the color of dirt on a dry day in the desert, which I have found useful to dash people's hopes of having rain to give them an excuse to not go on that date with the weird guy named Abner that sits in the back of the religion class to look at all of the potential mates that come in.  To Abner's shegrin, they are all married and/or dating someone because everyone taking <i>REL C 200 - The Eternal Family</i> is there because they are close to having a family and honestly have no idea how that works.
