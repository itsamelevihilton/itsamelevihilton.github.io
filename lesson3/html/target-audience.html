            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
                I imagine that the people who will be using this website will come for the comical approach to the weather.  Also I anticipate those of a more advanced age might stumble upon this website because they have not yet realized that their phones already come with a weather app.
            </p>

            <h3>Personas</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>I imagine the first user as being a younger person who spends too much time on reddit and has an impressive grasp on sarcasm.  He is likely a college student who obviously doesn't have balance in life and the comedy found on this site will be a daily escape from the reality of their unhappiness with how society tells them to spend their time.  This section is only slightly sarcastic in a dark humor because it's true sort of way.</li>
                <li>The second user of my website will have somehow found themselves here while desperately trying to find out if they can drive to their grandchild's piano recital.  Somehow they have found themselves on page 47 of their google results entering into a weather website unlike any other.  What will be even more exciting is how they miraculously know how to favorite websites AND share them on reddit.  This will bring many more of persona 1 to the website, feeding many generations of weather rock watchers.  They will likely be retired to have enough time to scroll through and look at hundreds of websites before stumbling upon this one.</li>

            <h3>Scenarios</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There is the aformentioned random stumble upon view where all the other weather websites just didn't give them what they were looking for.</li>
                <li>Due to the comedic balue on this site, many people will come to see the memes unfold before their eyes.  This will mostly come from links from reddit.</li>
                <ol>Honestly there are so many weather websites out there that have already built their reputation as well as their SEO to the point where it would be very difficult to start a successful weather website.  This being said these next scenarios are why I would visit a weather website in general.  
                    <li>For some reason my phone can't connect to the internet so I can't access the pre-installed weather app which keeps alerting me when there are sunny days in California just to rub in the cold, dark winters where I live.</li>
                    <li>For some reason both the Google Assistant and Amazon's Alexa aren't working so I can't ask them to get the weather information for me.  Or I left my assistant in Japanese for some reason and I can't understand a lick of what it says to me so I'm forced to only use it to turn on and off the lights because that is the one sentence I know in Japanese.</li>
                    <li>Another possible reason for visiting this website is if my workplace is super strict about what websites their employees can use and instead of using a whitelist to only allow the company website they use a blacklist along with an algorithm that watches their employees web interactions and blocks the most frequent ones in order to keep people working, though it eventually just turns into a game for the employees to find which websites haven't yet been blocked. </li>
